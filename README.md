A 3D maze game is created using Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) in C++, where the player attempts to solve the maze. The game's objective is to emerge through the open end of the maze, starting at a fixed point within it. The game creates enough illusions to challenge the playerâ€™s creative thinking and memorizing ability to unravel the only path outside the maze.

Maze structure is defined in maze.txt. You can change it on your own to create interesting designs.

For Linux :
  1. Install cmake (version 3.23)
  2. Install make.
  3. Open terminal.
  4. cmake CMakeLists.txt
  5. make
  6. ./maze_game
  7. Enjoy !
  
For Windows :
  1. Install CLion.
  2. Ensure you have OpenGL libraries installed on your PC.
  3. Change Bundled MinGW of CLion from its settings (Ctrl+Alt+S -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Toolchains -> Toolset) to installed location of MinGW on your PC.
  3. Run game.
  4. Enjoy !
